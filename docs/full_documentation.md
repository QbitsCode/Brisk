## Perceval Framework

### Overview

Perceval is an open source framework for programming photonic quantum computers, developed by Quandela. It provides tools for simulating, designing, and understanding photonic quantum computing systems.

> [!NOTE] 
> Perceval is integrated directly into Brisk, providing a seamless experience for quantum communications researchers and engineers. All Perceval functionality is accessible through the Brisk interface.

### Key Components

1. **Quantum Optical Circuits**
   - Linear optical circuits with beam splitters, phase shifters
   - Non-linear components (Kerr, cross-Kerr)
   - Sources (single photon, SPDC, coherent state)
   - Detectors (bucket, PNR, homodyne)

2. **Quantum State Manipulation**
   - State vector representation
   - Density matrix formalism
   - Unitary transformations
   - Measurement operations

> [!TIP]
> For optimal performance when working with large quantum states, use the sparse matrix representation option in the Perceval settings panel. This can significantly improve simulation speed for states with many photons.

### Basic Usage

Perceval can be used in Brisk through both the GUI and programmatically:

#### GUI Usage

1. Navigate to the Perceval tab in the main navigation
2. Use the circuit editor to drag and drop components
3. Configure component parameters using the properties panel
4. Run the simulation and view results in the visualization panel

#### Programmatic Usage

```python
from perceval.components import BS, PS, Circuit
from perceval.utils import BasicState

# Create a circuit
circuit = Circuit(2)  # 2-mode circuit
circuit.add(0, BS())  # Add a beam splitter at position 0
circuit.add(1, PS(phi=0.5))  # Add a phase shifter at position 1

# Define input state
input_state = BasicState([1, 1])  # |1,1âŸ© state (one photon in each mode)

# Simulate and get output state
output_state = circuit.evolve(input_state)
print(output_state)
```

> [!WARNING]
> Perceval simulations can be computationally intensive. For circuits with more than 10 photons, consider using the provided optimization techniques or enabling GPU acceleration.

### Advanced Features

#### Circuit Optimization

Perceval provides tools for optimizing circuits to achieve specific operations:

```python
from perceval.components.unitary_components import Unitary
from perceval.algorithms import Optimizer

# Define target unitary
target_unitary = Unitary([[0.5, -0.5, 0.5, 0.5], 
                          [0.5, 0.5, 0.5, -0.5],
                          [0.5, 0.5, -0.5, 0.5],
                          [0.5, -0.5, -0.5, -0.5]])

# Create optimizer
optimizer = Optimizer(target_unitary)
optimized_circuit = optimizer.optimize()
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When optimizing circuits, set a reasonable convergence threshold and maximum iterations to balance accuracy with computation time. The default values may not be appropriate for all applications.

#### Noise Modeling

Realistic quantum photonic simulations require accounting for imperfections:

```python
from perceval.utils import NoiseModel

# Define a noise model
noise = NoiseModel(loss_rate=0.01, dark_count_rate=1e-6)

# Apply to circuit simulation
noisy_output = circuit.evolve(input_state, noise_model=noise)
```

## GDSFactory Framework

### Overview

GDSFactory is a powerful Python library for designing photonic chips, including quantum photonic circuits. It enables the creation, simulation, and export of photonic components to industry-standard formats for fabrication.

### Quantum Components

#### Beam Splitters
Beam splitters are fundamental components in quantum photonic circuits, used to create superposition states.

Available Components:
- `directional_coupler`: Evanescent coupling between waveguides
- `mmi2x2`: Multimode interference coupler with 2 inputs and 2 outputs

#### Phase Shifters
Phase shifters allow controlled manipulation of quantum states by adjusting the optical path length.

Implementation Options:
- `delay_snake`: Physical path length difference
- `ring_single`: Ring resonators for phase control
- `heater_metal`: Thermo-optic phase shifter

#### Mach-Zehnder Interferometers
MZIs are essential building blocks for implementing quantum gates in photonic quantum computers.

Key Parameters:
- `delta_length`: Path length difference
- `splitter`: Type of splitter ('directional_coupler' or 'mmi2x2')

### API Reference

#### Component Creation
- `gf.Component()`: Create a new empty component
- `component.show()`: Display a component visualization
- `component.write_gds(filename)`: Save component to a GDS file

#### Quantum-Specific Components
- `gf.components.mzi()`: Mach-Zehnder interferometer
- `gf.components.mmi2x2()`: 2x2 multimode interference coupler
- `gf.components.coupler()`: Directional coupler
- `gf.components.ring_single()`: Single ring resonator

### Fabrication Guidelines

#### GDSII Export
GDSFactory designs can be exported to industry-standard GDSII format for fabrication:

```python
# Export a component to GDSII
component.write_gds("quantum_chip.gds")

# Export with specific settings
component.write_gds(
    "quantum_chip.gds",
    unit=1e-6,  # units in microns
    precision=1e-9  # nanometer precision
)
```

#### Quantum-Specific Fabrication Considerations
- **Low-Loss Requirements**: Quantum photonic circuits require extremely low-loss waveguides. Use curved waveguides with large bend radii (>20Î¼m for silicon) and minimize crossings.
- **Phase Stability**: Phase shifters should be carefully designed for thermal isolation to prevent crosstalk between quantum operations.
- **Symmetrical Couplers**: Beam splitters must be fabricated with high precision to achieve the desired splitting ratios for quantum operations.

   ```python
   # Create a custom GDSFactory component
   @gf.cell
   def custom_mzi(delta_length=10, width=0.5):
       # Implementation details
       c = gf.Component("custom_mzi")
       # Add waveguides, couplers, etc.
       return c
   ```

### Performance Optimization
Tips for optimizing simulations:
- Use the appropriate backend for your simulation size
- Limit the photon number for large circuits
- Consider symmetries to reduce computation time
- Use progressive refinement for complex simulations

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Backend Connection Failed
If the frontend cannot connect to the backend:
1. Ensure the backend is running on port 8000
2. Check that CORS is properly configured
3. Verify network connectivity between frontend and backend

#### Simulation Errors
If simulations fail:
1. Check input state validity (correct photon numbers)
2. Verify circuit connections are complete
3. Ensure phase parameters are within valid ranges
4. Check for memory limitations with large circuits

#### Visualization Issues
If visualizations don't appear:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify the circuit is valid
3. Try simplified circuits first
4. Ensure the backend returned valid visualization data
