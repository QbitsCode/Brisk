BRISK SPLASH VIDEO INSTRUCTIONS

To complete the splash screen implementation:

1. Export your video from the Canva design (https://www.canva.com/design/DAGjycJTRyI/vfF4nU8OklzpRRa0gQGC0A/edit) 
   as an MP4 file

2. Rename the file to "brisk-splash-video.mp4"

3. Place the file in this directory (/public/)

The splash screen is configured to play this 12-second video and 
then automatically redirect to the main application.

If you need to adjust the video timing, you can modify the timeout 
value in /src/components/splash/splash-screen.tsx
